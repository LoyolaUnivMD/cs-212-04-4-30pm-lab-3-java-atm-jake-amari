1. Import Scanner utility
2. Create main class
    a. Create Scanner object
    b. Prompt user for name, save as string name
    c. Initialize double userBalance as 212.90
    d. Initialize int leave as 0
    e. while leave = 0
        i. Welcome user using their name and ask what they would like to do, save as string choice
        ii. if choice is "withdraw"
            1a. Ask user how much to withdraw, save as double withdraw

            1a. Ask user how much to deposit, save as double deposit
            2a. Add deposit to userBalance, replace userBalance value with result
